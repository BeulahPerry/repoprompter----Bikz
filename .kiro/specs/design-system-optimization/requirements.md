# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RepoPrompter currently has an inconsistent and bloated design system with mixed styling approaches, redundant CSS, and spacing issues. This feature will consolidate and optimize the design system to create a cohesive, maintainable, and performant styling architecture that aligns with modern design principles and the product's Apple-inspired aesthetic.

2. WHEN I view different components THEN the spacing between elements SHALL be uniform and follow a consistent scale
3. WHEN I switch between light and dark modes THEN all components SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and readability
4. WHEN I hover over interactive elements THEN the feedback SHALL be immediate and consistent across all components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining RepoPrompter, I want a simplified and organized CSS architecture, so that styling changes are easy to implement and maintain.

2. WHEN I add new components THEN I SHALL be able to reuse existing design tokens and utility classes
3. WHEN I review the CSS codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or unused styles
4. WHEN I need to update the design system THEN changes SHALL propagate consistently across all components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of RepoPrompter, I want the file tree and directory selector to have clean, IDE-like styling, so that navigating my codebase feels familiar and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the file tree THEN it SHALL have clean lines, proper indentation, and clear visual hierarchy

2. WHEN I view modals THEN they SHALL have proper spacing, clear hierarchy, and consistent button placement
3. WHEN I use form controls THEN they SHALL align properly and have appropriate spacing between elements
4. WHEN I interact with buttons in different contexts THEN they SHALL maintain consistent sizing and styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of RepoPrompter, I want the application to load quickly and perform smoothly, so that my workflow is not interrupted by styling-related performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN CSS bundle size SHALL be minimized through removal of unused styles
2. WHEN I interact with the interface THEN there SHALL be no layout shifts or styling conflicts
3. WHEN I switch themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without flickering or broken states
